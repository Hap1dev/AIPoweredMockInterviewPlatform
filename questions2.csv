41,Software Development,"What is the difference between a class and an object?","A class is a blueprint or template that defines properties and behaviors for objects, whereas an object is an instance of a class created in memory.",Easy
42,Software Development,"Explain the concept of polymorphism in object-oriented programming.","Polymorphism allows a single interface to represent different underlying data types or methods, enabling code flexibility. For example, a function named `draw` could call the specific `draw` method of either a Circle or a Rectangle object at runtime.",Medium
43,Data Science and Machine Learning,"What is overfitting in machine learning?","Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model performs very well on the training data but poorly on unseen test data. This happens because the model learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern.",Easy
44,Data Science and Machine Learning,"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?","Supervised learning involves labeled data where the model learns from input-output pairs, whereas unsupervised learning involves unlabeled data, and the model identifies patterns or structures, like clustering.",Medium
45,Software Development,"Describe how a hash table works.","A hash table stores key-value pairs using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots. Keys are mapped to indices, allowing for fast retrieval, though collisions may occur and need resolution techniques like chaining or open addressing.",Hard
46,Data Science and Machine Learning,"Explain the concept of gradient descent.","Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent, as defined by the negative of the gradient.",Medium
47,Software Development,"What is a deadlock and how can it be avoided?","A deadlock occurs in a system when two or more processes are waiting for each other to release resources, preventing further progress. It can be avoided by ensuring resource allocation follows a defined order or by using methods like lock ordering and deadlock detection.",Hard
48,Data Science and Machine Learning,"What is feature scaling and why is it important?","Feature scaling standardizes the range of independent variables or features in data. It is important because many machine learning algorithms, like gradient descent and SVMs, converge faster and perform better when input features are on a similar scale.",Medium
49,Software Development,"What is the difference between a process and a thread?","A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space, while a thread is a smaller unit of a process that shares the process's memory and resources.",Easy
50,Data Science and Machine Learning,"What are the assumptions of linear regression?","Linear regression assumes linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), no multicollinearity, and normality of residuals.",Hard
