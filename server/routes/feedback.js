Here is a candidate's mock interview session. For each question, you'll find the candidate's answer, a correctness score (semantic similarity between expected and given answers), and facial expression metrics captured during the response.

üß† Correctness Score ranges from 0 to 1 ‚Äî higher means better answer relevance.

üòê Facial expression values (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise) also range from 0 to 1 ‚Äî higher means stronger expression. The facialExpressionScore is calculated as: (happiness - sadness - anger). A higher score generally means a more positive emotional tone.

Use these data points to provide an overall **spoken-style feedback** for the candidate. Your feedback should:
- Address their knowledge and accuracy.
- Reflect on their emotional composure or confidence based on expressions.
- Mention strengths, weaknesses, and improvement areas.
- Feel like it‚Äôs spoken directly to the candidate.
- Be around a paragraph in length.
